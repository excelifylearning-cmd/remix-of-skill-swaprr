      { q: "What is SkillSwappr?", a: "SkillSwappr is a peer-to-peer skill exchange marketplace where students and professionals trade skills using an internal currency called Skill Points (SP). Instead of paying cash, you exchange value through your expertise." },
      { q: "How do I create an account?", a: "Click 'Get Started' on the homepage. You'll enter your name, email, university (optional), and password. You'll receive 100 SP on signup to get started immediately." },
      { q: "Is it free to use?", a: "Yes! The Free tier gives you 5 gigs per month, 100 signup points, and full access to the marketplace. Premium tiers unlock more gigs, reduced taxes, and additional features." },
      { q: "Do I need to be a university student?", a: "No. While university verification gives you a trust badge and campus-specific features, anyone 16+ can join and use the platform." },
      { q: "What happens after I sign up?", a: "You'll complete your profile with skills you offer and skills you want, browse the marketplace, and start your first gig. Our AI will recommend matches based on your profile." },
      { q: "Can I use it on mobile?", a: "Yes, SkillSwappr is fully responsive and works on all devices. A dedicated mobile app is on our roadmap for Q3 2026." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What are Skill Points (SP)?", a: "Skill Points are the internal currency of SkillSwappr. They balance the value difference in skill exchanges and reward platform participation. They have no cash value and cannot be withdrawn." },
      { q: "How do I earn Skill Points?", a: "Complete gigs, get positive reviews, maintain daily streaks, participate in Skill Court, win achievements, refer friends, complete challenges, and participate in Guild Wars. Each activity earns different amounts." },
      { q: "What is the 5% tax?", a: "Both parties in a gig are taxed 5% of the transaction value upon completion. This prevents inflation, funds platform operations, and maintains a healthy economy. Premium tiers get reduced tax rates." },
      { q: "Can I buy Skill Points with real money?", a: "No. Skill Points are earned through platform activity only. This ensures the economy reflects real skill value, not purchasing power." },
      { q: "What happens to my points if I'm inactive?", a: "Points don't expire. However, your ELO rating may decay slightly after 60 days of inactivity. Logging in and completing any activity resets the decay timer." },
      { q: "How is pricing determined for gigs?", a: "Our AI analyzes market demand, skill complexity, seller ELO rating, and historical pricing to suggest fair point values. Both parties can negotiate the final amount." },

      { q: "What is a Direct Swap?", a: "A 1-on-1 skill exchange where both parties trade skills simultaneously. Points balance any value difference. Both sides are taxed 5% on completion." },
      { q: "How do Auctions work?", a: "Post a task and receive multiple submissions from creators. Review all entries, pick the best one — they get the most points. It's competitive and produces high-quality results." },
      { q: "What is Co-Creation Studio?", a: "A multi-person collaborative workspace with real-time whiteboard, video calls, and file sharing. Points are split by role contribution. Great for complex projects needing diverse skills." },
      { q: "What is Skill Fusion?", a: "Multi-skill gigs where one person fills multiple roles or several specialists collaborate. A single person with UX + coding skills might handle an entire app prototype." },
      { q: "How does Flash Market work?", a: "Time-limited gigs with bonus point multipliers (1.5x–3x). They expire within hours, creating urgency and rewarding fast, quality work." },
      { q: "Can I create recurring gigs?", a: "Yes! Subscription Gigs let you set up recurring exchanges — like weekly content creation for weekly graphic design. Both parties commit to a schedule." },

      { q: "What tools are in the workspace?", a: "Real-time messenger with auto-translation, tldraw whiteboard, peer-to-peer video calls with screen sharing, file library with version history, stage tracker, and AI quality panel." },
      { q: "Are video calls recorded?", a: "Yes, all video calls are automatically recorded and saved in the workspace file library. Both parties can access recordings for reference. Recordings are deleted 90 days after gig completion." },
      { q: "How does the stage tracker work?", a: "Break your gig into stages with point allocations per stage. As each stage is completed and approved, points are released. If someone abandons, you keep points for completed stages (insurance)." },
      { q: "Can I share files in the workspace?", a: "Yes. The file library supports all common formats, organizes files chronologically with version history, and includes search. Files are encrypted at rest and in transit." },
      { q: "What does the AI Quality Panel do?", a: "It runs plagiarism checks, provides quality scoring, predicts buyer satisfaction, compares versions, and checks delivery compliance against the original gig requirements." },

      { q: "How does SkillSwappr prevent scams?", a: "Multiple layers: AI scam pattern detection, digital fingerprinting of all deliverables, progressive work reveal (staged delivery), transaction codes for public verification, and the Skill Court dispute system." },
      { q: "What are Transaction Codes?", a: "Every completed gig gets a unique transaction code that anyone can look up to verify the exchange happened, view quality scores, and confirm authenticity. It's like a blockchain receipt." },
      { q: "How does the review system work?", a: "Both parties rate each other only after gig completion and deliverable verification. Reviews include a 1–5 star rating and written feedback. Coordinated manipulation is detected by AI and punished." },
      { q: "What is Digital Fingerprinting?", a: "All deliverables submitted through the platform contain invisible digital fingerprints for authenticity verification. This protects creators against unauthorized redistribution and proves ownership." },
      { q: "How do I report someone?", a: "Use the report button on any profile, gig, or message. Provide evidence if possible. Reports are reviewed within 24 hours. False reports are tracked and reduce your credibility score." },
      { q: "Is my data secure?", a: "All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). We conduct regular security audits, run a bug bounty program, and comply with GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 standards." },

    layout: "timeline" as const,
    faqs: [
      { q: "What is the ELO rating?", a: "A chess-like rating system that reflects your skill level and reliability. It affects search ranking, court eligibility, feature unlocks, and matchmaking. Higher ELO = more visibility and trust." },
      { q: "How are tiers determined?", a: "Based on lifetime activity: Bronze (0–499 ELO) → Silver (500–999) → Gold (1000–1499) → Platinum (1500–1799) → Diamond (1800+). Each tier unlocks progressive benefits like reduced taxes and priority support." },
      { q: "What are Skill Mastery levels?", a: "Per-skill progression separate from ELO: Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert → Master. You advance by completing gigs and receiving positive reviews in that specific skill category." },
      { q: "How do achievements work?", a: "50+ badges for milestones like 'First Gig,' '100 Swaps,' 'Perfect Rating Streak,' etc. Each achievement grants real benefits — reduced tax rates, bonus points, exclusive features, or cosmetic upgrades." },
      { q: "What are streaks?", a: "Complete at least one gig activity daily to maintain your streak. Streaks multiply bonus point earnings: 7-day = 1.5x, 14-day = 2x, 30-day = 3x. Breaking a streak resets the multiplier." },
      { q: "What is Quarterly Wrap?", a: "Every 3 months, you get a visual summary of your activity — like Spotify Wrapped but for skills. It shows gigs completed, points earned, skill growth, top collaborators, and fun stats." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What are Guilds?", a: "Teams of users who pool resources, share a treasury, compete in Guild Wars, and collaborate on projects. Guilds have shared portfolios, quality control processes, and collective ELO ratings." },
      { q: "How do I create or join a Guild?", a: "Create a guild from your dashboard (requires Gold tier+) or request to join existing guilds. Guild leaders approve new members based on skill fit and ELO requirements." },
      { q: "What is the Guild Treasury?", a: "A shared pool of Skill Points that members contribute to. The treasury funds member gigs, covers taxes, and grows through Guild War winnings. Leaders manage allocation." },
      { q: "How do Guild Wars work?", a: "Weekly competitions between guilds based on metrics like gig completion rate, average quality scores, and member growth. Winners receive treasury bonuses and exclusive badges." },
      { q: "Can guilds take on projects together?", a: "Yes! Guilds can accept multi-role projects and delegate tasks to the right specialists. The guild leader manages assignment, and points are distributed per role contribution." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What is Skill Court?", a: "Our dispute resolution system. When parties disagree on gig outcomes, Skill Court assembles a panel of judges to review evidence and make a fair ruling." },
      { q: "Who are the judges?", a: "A mix: 25% community users (randomly selected), 25% AI analysis, and 50% high-ELO experts in the relevant skill field. This ensures balanced, knowledgeable decisions." },
      { q: "How long do cases take?", a: "Most cases are resolved within 48–72 hours. Complex cases with multiple evidence submissions may take up to 5 business days. Both parties are notified at every stage." },
      { q: "Can I appeal a decision?", a: "Yes, each party gets one appeal per case. Appeals go to a higher-ELO panel for re-review. The appeal panel's decision is final." },
      { q: "Do I have to serve as a judge?", a: "Free tier users must serve as judges periodically to maintain gig privileges. It's a community responsibility. You earn points and ELO for fair judging." },
      { q: "How do verdicts affect ELO?", a: "The losing party's ELO decreases proportionally to the severity of the ruling. The winning party may receive an ELO boost. Judges who rule fairly earn bonus ELO." },

      { q: "What is Enterprise mode?", a: "A premium tier for businesses to access vetted, high-ELO student talent. Includes AI matching, project management dashboards, NDA/IP protection, and dedicated account managers." },
      { q: "How is talent vetted?", a: "Enterprise talent pool requires minimum Gold tier (1000+ ELO), 4.5+ star rating, 50+ completed gigs, and passes our AI quality assessment. Additional background checks for sensitive projects." },
      { q: "Can I hire students full-time?", a: "Yes! Our Direct Hire Pipeline lets you transition from gig work to full-time offers seamlessly. We track performance across gigs to build comprehensive candidate profiles." },
      { q: "What about IP and NDAs?", a: "Enterprise gigs include automatic NDA coverage. Full IP transfer agreements are available through our legal team. All work is digitally fingerprinted for ownership verification." },
      { q: "What integrations are available?", a: "Slack, Jira, Notion, GitHub, Figma, and custom API integrations. Enterprise plans include dedicated integration support and custom webhook configurations." },

      { q: "Can I downgrade my plan?", a: "Yes, you can downgrade at any time. Your current plan benefits continue until the end of your billing cycle. Unused premium features will be restricted after downgrade." },
      { q: "How do I delete my account?", a: "Go to Settings > Account > Delete Account. All data is purged within 30 days. Active gigs must be completed or cancelled first. Skill Points are forfeited upon deletion." },
